# Python-Games
The following repository contains some of the small scale games that I am trying to make using python and via the pygaemes library.
To run the following games on your machine make sure to have the the pygame and pgzero packages form pyton. 
To check the packages:
pgzero --version
pygame --version
To install them:
pip install pygame
pip install pgzero
